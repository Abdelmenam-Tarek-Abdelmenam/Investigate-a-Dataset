project by udacity dataanalysis nanodegree . i used tmbd dataset 

Project Overview :-
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it.
 You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.


introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that
 documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming
 what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the 
questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be
 required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you 
should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is 
open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
